### Github Discussion:
During the practice of the topics we expect to have some problems and hoping you will be solving them by
  - watching the video again to find what you have missed
  - delete the things you have done and start from scratch again for a couple of times
Still if you have done those things and still you need some help around it then you can create a discussion with trainer. Following is the link to create a discussions.
